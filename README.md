# GuessFlipCoin

This project is for observer pattern practice.(java)

When flip a coin ten thousand times, which strategy of guessing will you use? here is two posibility  ( let's assume positive side is 1, negative side is 0)
1. use adaptive expectation regression strategy, because in total the expectation will be 0.5 roughly. If positive side emerged more than negative side, we guess negative next time, vice versa.
2. use random strategy.
